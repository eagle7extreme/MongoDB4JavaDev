Finding the most frequent author of comments on your blog
In this assignment you will use the aggregation framework to find the most frequent author of comments on your blog. We will be using the same dataset as last week. 

Import posts.json into your blog database as follows:
mongoimport -d hw5 -c posts --drop < posts.json

Now use the aggregation framework to calculate the author with the greatest number of comments. 

To help you verify your work before submitting, the author with the least comments is Efrain Claw and he commented 384 times. 

Result: hw5-1.json
