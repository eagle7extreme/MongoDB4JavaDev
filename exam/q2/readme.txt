Final: Question 2
Please use the Enron dataset you imported for the previous problem. For this question you will use the aggregation framework to figure out pairs of people that tend to communicate a lot. 

Turns out that the top channel is veronica.espinoza@enron.com to recipients@enron.com, with 2181 messages. But that is not very interesting, so your task is to figure out the second most popular pair of sender and recipient and indicate it below. 

Update: a few people have pointed out that a recipient sometimes appears more than once in the To header of a message. For our purposes, you can double count when that occurs. I did not consider it when designing the problem. 



A. susan.mara@enron.com to jeff.dasovich@enron.com

B. susan.mara@enron.com to richard.shapiro@enron.com

C. soblander@carrfut.com to soblander@carrfut.com

D .susan.mara@enron.com to james.steffes@enron.com
